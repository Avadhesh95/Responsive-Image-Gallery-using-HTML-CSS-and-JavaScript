This is a static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To run this website locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    >> git clone https://github.com/Avadhesh95/Responsive-Image-Gallery-using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking on the file and it should open in your default web browser.

4. Alternatively, you can run a local server to view the website. There are several options for running a local server, but we recommend using Python's built-in http.server module.

    * Once you have Python installed, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

    >> python -m http.server

    This will start a local server on port 8000 by default. You can now open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to view the website.

That's it! You should now be able to view the static website locally.
